          data-title="Chi-Square Analysis for Hypothesis Testing and Independence" 
          data-description="This project utilized Chi-Square statistical tests to analyze datasets from two domains: hospital admissions and driver records. The first task involved a Chi-Square Goodness-of-Fit test on Changi General Hospital’s monthly admission data over six years (2018–2023). The objective was to assess whether admissions followed a Poisson distribution. Data preprocessing included binning admission counts to meet minimum expected frequencies, calculating probabilities using the Poisson formula, and summing Chi-Square contributions for each bin. Results rejected the null hypothesis, indicating the data did not follow a Poisson distribution.
          
          The second task employed a Chi-Square Test of Independence on driver data to explore the relationship between gender and “Drunk” status. A contingency table was constructed to calculate observed and expected frequencies, and Chi-Square statistics were derived. Results failed to reject the null hypothesis, implying independence between the two variables. This project demonstrated advanced statistical analysis techniques, leveraging tools like Excel for computations and hypothesis testing."

          data-description="This project involved a comprehensive Business Intelligence workflow using Alteryx to analyze hotel booking data. Multiple data types (CSV, XML, XLSX, MySQL) were integrated into a unified schema. Key preprocessing tasks included handling missing values, normalizing date formats, and creating derived metrics like booking windows, occupancy rates, and membership tiers using SCD Type 2.

          Advanced transformations facilitated insights into seasonal occupancy trends, cancellation patterns, and booking behaviors. For instance, analysis revealed high cancellation rates among elite-tier members and significant seasonal fluctuations in occupancy rates. Visualizations created in Alteryx highlighted trends by week, month, and booking channel, guiding recommendations for targeted marketing and resource allocation. The project culminated in actionable strategies to enhance hotel performance, such as improving direct booking channels and offering incentives to reduce cancellations."

          data-description="This Data Science project applied the CRISP-DM framework to predict cruise sales, using Jupyter Lab as the workspace. Beginning with data understanding, exploratory data analysis (EDA) identified key factors affecting ticket sales, such as discounts and booking channels. Data preparation included feature engineering, handling missing values, and correlation analysis to select the most relevant features.

          Machine learning models, including linear regression, logistic regression, and clustering algorithms (e.g., k-means), were developed to uncover sales patterns and predict customer behaviors. Models were evaluated using metrics such as R-squared, precision, and recall to ensure reliability. The project delivered actionable insights, such as which customer segments were most responsive to discounts, enabling tailored marketing strategies. This work showcased a complete end-to-end data science pipeline, emphasizing machine learning’s role in operational decision-making."

          data-description="This quantitative finance project focused on designing and implementing a systematic trading strategy based on salience theory research papers. The project began with an in-depth analysis of the methodology, including its approach to signal generation and portfolio construction. To ensure its applicability and robustness, the strategy was adapted to the SP500. A backtesting framework was developed using Python, pandas, and NumPy to evaluate the strategy’s performance over historical market data. The strategy achieved an annualized return of approximately 20% and a Sharpe ratio of 1.11, demonstrating strong risk-adjusted performance."
